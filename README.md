Our Build Numbering scheme is

(Number)(Number)(Number)(Number)(Number)(Number)(Number)(Letter)

The first number is the main version
the second number is the major update number 
the third number is the minor update number 
the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th is the build number (1001 - 9999) 
the letter is the revision (a-z)

Old build numbers are six digits and only letters a-i are used
